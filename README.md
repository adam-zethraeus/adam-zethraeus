I'm building [ðŸŒ³ StateTree](https://github.com/GoodHatsLLC/StateTree), a better state management system.
* Platfrom agnostic Swift.
* UI layer independent.
* Reactive & data driven. _Not a Redux._

```markdown
## Your app is not its UI.

But OS's developers are incentived to tie it all up in their proprietary APIs.

1. How do we make app state management better?
2. Is UI development as easy as it can be?
3. What can we learn from:
  -  Elm, Redux, Flux, MobX, TCA?
  -  React, SwiftUI, Compose?
  -  Other state and UI management paradigms and frameworks?

What does app _development and design_ look like when
an __app's interface is an API, not a UI?__
```
